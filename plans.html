            <h2>My Story</h2>
            <h5>Wisdom, Goodness, and the Power of Perseverance</h5>
          
            <p>
              My name is Joseph Peter Kamvabingu. I believe that wisdom is found not only in knowledge but in how we rise after setbacks—and that true goodness shines when we uplift others along the way.
            </p>
          
            <p>
              Growing up with a deep passion for technology and a heart for my community, I always dreamed of making a difference. After completing Secondary School, I enrolled at a university in Lilongwe to study Computer Science. Though I faced financial hardship that cut my studies short, I never let go of my dreams.
            </p>
          
            <p>
              Along my journey, I was blessed with remarkable people—mentors like Fazwell Mwanguku, who introduced me to programming, and friends like my twin brother Emmanuel, whose shared passion kept us motivated. I also learned web development from Isaac, a brilliant friend whose guidance opened new doors for me.
            </p>
          
            <p>
              With determination, I joined TME Education Africa and sharpened my skills in programming and electronics. I met incredible individuals through church and community, like Brenno Allen, whose encouragement eventually led to our co-founding of <strong>Code-Tailors</strong>.
            </p>
          
            <p>
              Today, I lead Code-Tailors, a company that uses technology to empower communities. I’m also the founder of <strong>Dziko Lathu</strong>, a platform promoting innovation and grassroots development in Malawi. Through projects like the <strong>Dziko Lathu organizations</strong>, I advocate for inclusive education and support for underprivileged children.
            </p>
          
            <p>
              I strive to live with purpose, compassion, and vision. I believe in a future shaped by collaboration, creativity, and kindness—and I’m committed to playing my part in making it a reality.
            </p>
          
            <p>
              This is my journey. One of wisdom, goodness, and unwavering belief in the power of community. May it remind others that no matter the challenges, we all have the power to build something meaningful.
